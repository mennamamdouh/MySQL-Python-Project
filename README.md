# MySQL-Python-Project
This repository is for my project on creating connections between MySQL server and Python applications.
This repository contains one ipynb file, this file executes many queries through a python notebook, those queries perform:
  1. Creating a database
  2. Creating tables inside the database
  3. Inserting data into the tables
  4. Doing some analysis on this data
  5. Making connections between MySQL server and the Python code using cursors
  6. Creating connection pools for different users
